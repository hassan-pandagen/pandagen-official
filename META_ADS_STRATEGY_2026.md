## 📊 **EXPECTED ROI TIMELINE**

- Month 2: 50 leads × $3,000 avg project = $150,000 pipeline
- Month 3: 75 leads × $3,000 avg project = $225,000 pipeline

Assuming 10% close rate = $9K - $22.5K revenue/month
Total ad spend: $9,000 (3 months)
Total revenue: $46,500+ (3-month close cycle)
**Net ROI: 417%**

---

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION**

Meta ads are 60% cheaper than Google Ads for B2B leads ($27 vs $70 CPL). While LinkedIn has higher quality leads, Meta excels at:
- **Top-of-funnel awareness** (cold traffic)
- **Cost-efficient lead volume**
- **Visual storytelling** (carousel/video)
- **Retargeting** (warm traffic)

Start with **$2,000-3,000/month** minimum for meaningful data. Focus on **carousel ads** (30-50% lower cost) with **problem-solution narratives**. Use **broad targeting** with first-party signals for best AI optimization.
